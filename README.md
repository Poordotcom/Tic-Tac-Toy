Tic Tac Toy is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in C++. It allows two players to take turns placing their respective symbols ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive main menu with options to start the game or exit.
- Colorful output using ANSI Escape Codes for enhanced user experience.
- Clear instructions for players on how to play the game.
- Automatic detection of the winner or a draw at the end of the game.
- Well-organized code structure with comments for better readability and maintainability.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the executable file.
2. Choose "Start Game" from the main menu.
3. Players take turns entering numbers to place their symbols ('X' or 'O') on the game board.
4. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
5. If all cells on the game board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
